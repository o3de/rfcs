# RFCs
RFCs for the Open 3D Foundation products.

Anyone can author a proposal and submit it as an RFC document. RFCs should follow the formatting defined in the RFC template. While not all sections will be directly applicable to a given proposal, authors should ensure that their proposals clearly explain the proposal being discussed, the problem that it solves, and the approach being considered. When a proposal is submitted to the RFC repo, it will be in the 'proposed' state. As comments are added and the proposal is reviewed, it may be approved by a SIG and moved into an 'accepted' state.    

### Submitting an RFC
When you are proposing an RFC, submit a pull request to the subdirectory for the appropriate special interest group, making sure to follow the naming convention described in [sigs/readme.md](sigs/readme.md). The root of your pull request should be a directory with all necessary files. The body of the RFC should be in your RFC's readme.md file and can reference additional artifacts within the RFC folder. 

### Providing feedback on an RFC document
Feedback can be provided directly on the pull request as a review, or you can create issues to discuss single-threaded topics related to a specific RFC. If you create an issue thread for an RFC, ensure that you follow the naming convention in the issue title to clearly identify the RFC you are referring to. 


## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is an RFC?
RFC stands for 'request for comments'. The RFC process is the mechanism for making significant decisions about O3DE, including things like new feature development proposals, major changes to existing functionality, and design guidelines. An RFC refers to the proposal, supporting documents, and comments that make up a decision about the O3DE code base. 

### I have an idea for a new feature for O3DE - how do I get started?
The RFC template provided can help you draft out an initial plan for your proposal. Use the SIG mailing lists or Discord server to share your idea and solicit ideas from the wider O3DE community to mature the proposal before submitting it as an RFC, and expect the RFC process to result in changes. As an RFC author, your focus will be on building consensus around your proposal and ensuring that major questions about its development are answered. 

### Can an RFC have multiple authors?
Yes - in fact, it's encouraged. By collaborating with multiple authors on an RFC, you will have a wider range of knowledge to build on for your initial proposal. For example, you may have one author who focuses on the goals, rationale, and overview of the solution while other authors write the initial design and implementation detail for your proposal
