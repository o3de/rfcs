# RFCs
RFCs for the Open 3D Foundation products

## Submitting an RFC
When you are proposing an RFC, submit a pull request following the naming convention described in sigs/readme.md. The root of your pull request should be a directory with all necessary files contained in the top-level directory. The body of the RFC should be in the readme.md file and can reference additional artifacts within the RFC folder. 

## Providing feedback on an RFC
Feedback can be provided directly on the pull request as a review, or you can create issues to discuss single-threaded topics related to a given RFC. If you create an issue thread for an RFC, ensure that you follow the naming convention in the issue title to clearly identify the RFC you are referring to.
